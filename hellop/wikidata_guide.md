Welcome to our page dedicated to Wikidata exploration! This page serves two essential functions: keyword frequency analysis and tag validation against Wikidata entries.

<b>Keyword Frequency Analysis</b>: Our first function revolves around identifying and counting the most frequently used keywords within our dataset. This process provides valuable insights into the themes and subjects that dominate the content.

<b>Tag Validation against Wikidata</b>: Our second function involves a meticulous comparison of the most commonly used tags with the extensive database of Wikidata keywords. This analysis helps us determine whether the tags employed align with recognized concepts within the Wikidata ecosystem.
