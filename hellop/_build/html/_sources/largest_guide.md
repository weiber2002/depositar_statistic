<h3><b>Illuminating Insights in Two Formats</b></h3>
We recognize the diverse ways in which information resonates with different users. To cater to varied preferences, we present our statistical findings in two distinct formats:

* **List Format**: For those who appreciate a structured overview, we present our insights in a clear and concise list format. This format enables you to quickly scan through the most frequently used data points, gaining a snapshot of the prevailing trends within the dataset.
<br>ex: [{name1,value1},{name2,value2}.....]</br>

* **Bar Graph**: Visuals are powerful tools for comprehension. Our meticulously crafted bar graphs offer a visual representation of data usage frequency. With intuitive labels and a clear scale, you can effortlessly identify patterns and anomalies, facilitating deeper analysis.
